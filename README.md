# EMD2Unity

Native **Unity 2022.3+** Editor package for experimenting with PS3 Kamen Rider *Battride War / Battride War Genesis (Sousei)* `.EMD` models. The parser was rewritten in C# based on the format research of [Random Talking Bush](https://github.com/RandomTBush/RTB-3DSMax-Scripts/blob/main/Scripts/KamenRiderPS3_EMD.ms).

> **Experimental:** The Editor assembly was previously compiled in Unity 2022.3.62f3. Version 0.1.3 corrects triangle-index count semantics using real DLC EMD samples; Unity reimport and visual rig validation remain pending. It may require fixes for particular models.

## Install directly from this GitHub repository

Unity → **Window → Package Manager → + → Add package from git URL...**

```text
https://github.com/MusafirEx/EMD2Unity.git
```

A Git package installs from the repository root (`package.json`). It is named `com.musafirex.emd2unity`. To install a local checkout use **Add package from disk...** and choose its root `package.json`.

### Classic Unity package

Download the `.unitypackage` from the package build workflow or create it locally:

```bash
python Tools/build_unitypackage.py --output EMD2Unity-v0.1.3.unitypackage
```

Then in Unity select **Assets → Import Package → Custom Package...** and select the resulting archive. **Do not install both the UPM package and the classic Assets package**, which would register the same importer twice.

## How to use

1. Extract `.EMD` model files from your own game files. This package does not extract NCAT archives or package game assets.
2. Place `*.EMD` in `Assets/Models/`. Unity creates an imported prefab-like GameObject.
3. Select the EMD and use the **Model / Rig / Materials / Animation** Inspector tabs. The animation tab is currently **informational only**; this importer does not parse animation sequences.
4. For texture matching, put extracted `*.dds`, `*.png`, `*.tga` or `*.jpg` in a sibling `textures/` directory. Texture association is best-effort.
5. Change **Reverse Triangle Winding** if faces are inverted, and test the rig by moving bones.
